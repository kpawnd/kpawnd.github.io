After I turned 14, I stopped celebrating my birthday. It might come as a shock to some. How can someone not celebrate their birthday? It's your special day of the year after all. So why wouldn’t you celebrate?

My answer is that no one bothered to celebrate my birthday. I remember in fifth grade I told my friends that my birthday was a week away and that I was looking forward to celebrating it. The day came, and nobody wished me a happy birthday, nope not even a slight acknowledgment, yet they remembered another person’s birthday two days prior and even commented that my birthday was shortly after theirs.

I even brought a cake to share with my friends, but they never sat with me. I invited one of my friends to come over and celebrate with me, but they never showed up. I asked them the next day why they didn’t come, and they said they didn’t know and were busy yet I found out they were out playing with the rest. This happened the following year, and after that so I stopped celebrating my birthday altogether. This made me realize that none of my friends truly cared about me.

I expected this might change in university with a fresh start and new friends. I hoped someone would remember my birthday. Only two people did, one out of pity, and the other genuinely remembered. I already mentioned it in one of my posts, If you want, you can read it after this post.

My parents have always struggled to remember my birthday, and I don’t hold it against them. They often don’t remember their own social security numbers or even their own birthdays. I always have to remind them, and they would simply wish me a happy birthday. I never asked for gifts or expected any. I know deep down that my parents love me and will try to get me what I want at the right time.

“It’s just a birthday, don’t be upset,” people often say. But that acknowledgment tells you that, to someone, you matter. Despite lacking this acknowledgment I try to celebrate other people’s birthdays whenever I can even if it’s late or the person and I are not in touch often because I know how much that acknowledgment means to someone. Doing this provides what I couldn’t have, and it makes me feel somewhat better about my own situation. I’m not hurt but a slight acknowledgment can be refreshing.
