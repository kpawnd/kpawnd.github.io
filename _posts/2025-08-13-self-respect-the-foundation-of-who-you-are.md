You know, as I grew up, I barely had any self respect for myself. I’m not ashamed of admitting it if anything, admitting it helps in fixing the problem, which I do see as a problem that I have.

It started affecting me in many ways, and one of them was how people treated me. If you lack respect for yourself, then no one will respect you. Your opinion will be ignored, and you, as a whole, will be ignored. It’s almost as if you do not exist and that nobody will listen to what you have to say. This realisation will have you crumbling down.

I’ve always been the butt of the joke, and I couldn’t help it but just sit there and laugh it off because not all jokes deserve the energy and the time of day for you to defend yourself. After all, if it’s a nothing burger, you’ll just be considered a mood buster. But sometimes these jokes tear into the man you are. They make you doubt and question yourself, and you feel a sudden wave of sadness.

If it’s between you and your friends, that’s okay. If you don’t like the joke, you could always tell your friend that you did not like it, and if they’re understanding, they’ll apologise and never do it again.

And by the way, it doesn’t have to be jokes. It could be any situation, maybe a girl or a guy playing with you, ruining your mental state. It sure happened to me, and I never had the self respect to quit chasing a person even after they had disrespected me.

After feeling deeply hurt, not because all my effort to win someone had failed miserably, but because of the disrespect my last name had received, I was pushed towards hatred. Without realising it, I started backbiting that person, all because I felt like my pride and self were humiliated. I can sit here and try to justify what I did, but that’s wrong.

It’s not that person’s fault. Yes, they have disrespected me. Yes, they have toyed with my mental well being. But that does not justify going around and backbiting. How different am I from them? I’m the one who put myself in that situation in the first place. None of this would’ve happened if I knew my worth and looked somewhere else.

Instead of looking for answers for my actions, I blamed someone for my misfortune, and that blinded me from discovering issues about myself. It’s fascinating how, though it’s been nearly a year since that situation happened, over the past few months I’ve started to reflect on it more.

I keep giving myself a hard time, but I’ve never forgiven myself for the countless situations I have put myself through. But they serve as lessons to be learned. You experience new things as you go through situations in life, albeit drama, pain, or suffering. Whatever it may be, it’s a learning experience, and a fun one too, once you start reflecting on it.

It’s going to suck, and your thoughts are going to be scattered all over the place, but that’s the beauty of it. To respect yourself is to love yourself first and foremost, and be more forgiving to yourself. Yesterday’s you is far different from today’s you.
