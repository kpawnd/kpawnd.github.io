I don’t understand how people can willingly let others put them down and then brush it off as if nothing happened usually because they’ve internalized that they deserve it. Jokes themselves aren’t inherently bad they can lighten the mood in the right setting. But when it’s an obvious jab meant to humiliate, it stops being a joke.

I’ve stood up for many people, not because I’m some saint (believe me, I’m far from it), but because I’ve been in that position myself. I know how hard it is to stand your ground or speak up. Nobody wants to cause unnecessary tension, but the truth is, the tension already exists. A jab of humiliation doesn’t come from nowhere it always stems from tension. Once it’s there, it’s like adding fuel to a fire.

I’ve never regretted standing up for anybody. For one, it shows that in a group of people, at least one person still has some ounce of humanity left. And beyond that, standing up for someone else doesn’t just help them, it also reveals something about yourself.

That brings me to a situation that still perplexes me, how far can a person (WILLINGLY) degrade themselves in the pursuit of attention? Low self-worth or maybe fear of rejection. I’ll admit I’m guilty of it too. I think most of us are, in some way. Off the top of my head, situationships come to mind.

I actually lost (sort of) my friend group because of two individuals who for better or worse never got much attention from the opposite sex. I don't drop any names so let's use letters to identify the individuals. Let’s call them Friend A and Friend B. They were, or maybe still are, the “crushes” of two others in the group, Mutuals C and D. The thing is, A and B didn’t see C and D in the same way, to them, it was just friendship.

It all came to a head at a gathering, where another mutual, let’s call him E, a friend of A and B, decided to point it out repeatedly in the form of humiliating jabs. He did it without any remorse, making it painfully obvious. And honestly, what bothered me even more was that A and B just let it happen. I kept staring at them, silently asking, How can you just sit there and let him keep going? They’re your friends what the hell? Eventually, I snapped. Out of anger, I stepped in and shut down the humiliation ritual right then and there. Maybe I shouldn’t have, especially given the two-faced nature of C and D, which did come back to bite me later. But I don’t regret it. I’d rather take that hit than sit by and act like a piece of shit.

Despite all of this, instead of directing their anger and hate toward the ones who allowed it to happen in the first place, I was the one who took the fall. That pissed me off but then I reminded myself, I’m dealing with people who aren’t right in the head to begin with and CAN never take accountability. It was already a losing battle. There’s no point in trying to prove I had their best interests at heart, because you can’t convince someone who refuses to see reason. Just to be clear, I don’t hate or despise C, D, or even E. Hate is a strong word, and directing it at someone over a single situation would be irrational. I don’t dabble in irrationality. What this does serve as, though, is a reminder that I should expect anything from people like this. Those who can’t see reason are dangerous in their own way. They’ll stop at nothing to look past their own belittled sense of self-worth.
