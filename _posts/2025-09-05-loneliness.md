Most of us are afraid of loneliness. A lot of us associate loneliness with negativity but that's not always true, some of us prefer to be alone due many reasons. For a while now my comfort zone was and still is secluding myself from the outside world not because I'm shy or anything it's because I can't communicate and I'm socially anxious around people. There's no shame in admiting that I have difficulty in communicating with others. I'm fortunate enough to realize this before turning twenty because I can still work on this.

I will come back to this post and update it to let you know about my progress, until then bye.
