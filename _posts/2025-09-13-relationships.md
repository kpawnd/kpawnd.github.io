Relationships are not for everybody. Many of us unfortunately, are like broken records, often chasing whatever feels good in the moment. It’s tempting to express attraction to someone that’s completely normal, human even. But have you ever stopped to ask yourself is this person the right partner for me? Or Am I the right partner for them?

The first question usually gets attention, because you only find the answer by getting to know the other person. But the second question is often neglected. Being brutally honest with yourself is difficult it can be exhausting, even discouraging. Yet it’s really necessary.

We all have issues, imperfections if you will, and these can directly affect the people we enter relationships with. Before confessing to your crush, ask yourself What baggage am I bringing along? Because not everyone wants to, or even has the capacity to, handle it. Don’t be selfish. Fix your problems before expecting someone else to accept them.
