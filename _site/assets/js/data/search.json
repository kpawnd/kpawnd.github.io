    "content": "You know, as I grew up, I barely had any self respect for myself. I’m not ashamed of admitting it if anything, admitting it helps in fixing the problem, which I do see as a problem that I have.  It started affecting me in many ways, and one of them was how people treated me. If you lack respect for yourself, then no one will respect you. Your opinion will be ignored, and you, as a whole, will be ignored. It’s almost as if you do not exist and that nobody will listen to what you have to say. This realisation will have you crumbling down.  I’ve always been the butt of the joke, and I couldn’t help it but just sit there and laugh it off because not all jokes deserve the energy and the time of day for you to defend yourself. After all, if it’s a nothing burger, you’ll just be considered a mood buster. But sometimes these jokes tear into the man you are. They make you doubt and question yourself, and you feel a sudden wave of sadness.  If it’s between you and your friends, that’s okay. If you don’t like the joke, you could always tell your friend that you did not like it, and if they’re understanding, they’ll apologise and never do it again.  And by the way, it doesn’t have to be jokes. It could be any situation, maybe a girl or a guy playing with you, ruining your mental state. It sure happened to me, and I never had the self respect to quit chasing a person even after they had disrespected me.  After feeling deeply hurt, not because all my effort to win someone had failed miserably, but because of the disrespect my last name had received, I was pushed towards hatred. Without realising it, I started backbiting that person, all because I felt like my pride and self were humiliated. I can sit here and try to justify what I did, but that’s wrong.  It’s not that person’s fault. Yes, they have disrespected me. Yes, they have toyed with my mental well being. But that does not justify going around and backbiting. How different am I from them? I’m the one who put myself in that situation in the first place. None of this would’ve happened if I knew my worth and looked somewhere else.  Instead of looking for answers for my actions, I blamed someone for my misfortune, and that blinded me from discovering issues about myself. It’s fascinating how, though it’s been nearly a year since that situation happened, over the past few months I’ve started to reflect on it more.  I keep giving myself a hard time, but I’ve never forgiven myself for the countless situations I have put myself through. But they serve as lessons to be learned. You experience new things as you go through situations in life, albeit drama, pain, or suffering. Whatever it may be, it’s a learning experience, and a fun one too, once you start reflecting on it.  It’s going to suck, and your thoughts are going to be scattered all over the place, but that’s the beauty of it. To respect yourself is to love yourself first and foremost, and be more forgiving to yourself. Yesterday’s you is far different from today’s you. "

    "content": "I’ve survived my first year of engineering school and I’d think that’s a big deal. I don’t want to jinx it or anything, but I really have no idea what the next couple of years bring. Whatever, it’s always nice to look on the positive side.  First year was okay. The stuff we did in class wasn’t difficult although I think I’m part of that tiny percentage who believes so. I was already familiar with a lot of it, as I had covered the same material in high school. Just like with any college class, getting a quality professor is like winning the lottery you get lucky with someone who enjoys teaching, or you get someone less than adequate. But really, all that doesn’t matter so much because you will need to self-study regardless.  Engineering isn’t easy. There’s no sugarcoating it. You’ll need to pour in an ungodly amount of time and effort not just to pass, but to truly understand the material.  Your objective shouldn’t be to just pass it should be to understand. Read that again.  You have to be highly conscious of your time. Let me present you with the 3x Rule, that is, for every credit hour of a course, you should be prepared to spend three times as many hours per week in class and studying. Therefore, a 3 credit course is 9 hours of overall weekly work.  Of course, the 3x Rule applies only if the material you are studying is actually good. I did not rely on the slides that lecturers provided as they were incomplete and don’t explain the concepts properly. I used them only for instant revision. Rather, I used to study the reference books listed in the subject descriptors. Those books may be dense with content, but they fill the gaps and offer you a solid foundation.  Of course, this only works if you have a good and solid study habit. Reading and memorizing is not going to cut it. You can possibly vomit a thing or two on the exam paper, but that’s nothing short of pattern recognition at best. You need to be able to comprehend the material well enough that you can teach it to others. That is how you know you’ve truly learned.  No study schedule of voodoo I pay attention to, no insane spaced repetition rituals in which I associate random objects in the house with formulas. Read the material with the intention of learning something, you wanna get out of this study session with the aim of grasping the theory behind the topic you are actively learning and try applying it somewhere outside of the use you are comfortable with. I used the laplace transform in circuit analysis to solve circuit problems. I took something that I learned from math and applied it to another subject.  It is also useful to quiz yourself occasionally. Something that was super useful to me was having Gemini or ChatGPT generate multiple choice questions on whatever topic I was studying. I did it a lot when I was learning about programming concepts. "

    "content": "Apologizing after a long time can be really difficult. For example, I sometimes struggle with this  I know I’ve hurt people or been an ass, but I either didn’t apologize at the right time, or when I did, it didn’t come across as sincere.  On one hand, I want to apologize. On the other hand, I hesitate because it’s been a while, and maybe the person has already forgotten about it. Would apologizing now seem insincere, or could it even cause more issues?  I have hurt many people, including some of those closest to me. Whether I meant to or not, it doesn’t justify it. I haven’t made many positive impressions yet in my first year of university, meeting new people and speaking to them. This really gets to me and keeps me up at night sometimes. But at some point, I have to snap out of it being obsessed with the past won’t allow me to move forward. I need to learn to forgive myself and not be too hard on myself.  You encounter hundreds, maybe thousands, of new people every day. So what if you made a bad impression on a dozen or so? You can either obsess over it and jeopardize your mental health, or you can opt to move on and do your best at the social game.  It’s about learning how to become a better person, and I hate to admit this, but I came to accept it. I’m really an asshole, and this is evident in my delivery and my tone when talking to people. I lack kindness, sympathy, and empathy those are the very things that make you human. I easily get annoyed, and my reactions do not make any positive impressions, and individuals tend to despise communicating with me due to this. To begin with, I have to do something about this. I cannot just disregard this anymore this is beginning to get to me. Younger me would just brush this off and just continue living life, not entirely understanding the implications this will bring. Everything begins at home. If I am going to alter the way I speak to others, I need to begin with those that are closest to me.  I only wish that people won’t remember me for my old self, but the new me who is attempting to change. It’s hard enough to endure change and have people still perceive you in an old way, but I and neither should you give it any care in the world, as you are undertaking this for your own sake, not theirs. Actions speak louder than your keyboard.  “I am not what happened to me, I am what I choose to become.” - Carl Jung "
