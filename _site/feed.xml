  <summary>You know, as I grew up, I barely had any self respect for myself. I’m not ashamed of admitting it if anything, admitting it helps in fixing the problem, which I do see as a problem that I have.  It started affecting me in many ways, and one of them was how people treated me. If you lack respect for yourself, then no one will respect you. Your opinion will be ignored, and you, as a whole, will b...</summary>

  <summary>I’ve survived my first year of engineering school and I’d think that’s a big deal. I don’t want to jinx it or anything, but I really have no idea what the next couple of years bring. Whatever, it’s always nice to look on the positive side.  First year was okay. The stuff we did in class wasn’t difficult although I think I’m part of that tiny percentage who believes so. I was already familiar wi...</summary>
