  <summary>Relationships are not for everybody. Many of us unfortunately, are like broken records, often chasing whatever feels good in the moment. It’s tempting to express attraction to someone that’s completely normal, human even. But have you ever stopped to ask yourself is this person the right partner for me? Or Am I the right partner for them?  The first question usually gets attention, because you ...</summary>

  <summary>After I turned 14, I stopped celebrating my birthday. It might come as a shock to some. How can someone not celebrate their birthday? It’s your special day of the year after all. So why wouldn’t you celebrate?  My answer is that no one bothered to celebrate my birthday. I remember in fifth grade I told my friends that my birthday was a week away and that I was looking forward to celebrating it....</summary>

  <summary>Most of us are afraid of loneliness. A lot of us associate loneliness with negativity but that’s not always true, some of us prefer to be alone due many reasons. For a while now my comfort zone was and still is secluding myself from the outside world not because I’m shy or anything it’s because I can’t communicate and I’m socially anxious around people. There’s no shame in admiting that I have ...</summary>

  <summary>You know, as I grew up, I barely had any self respect for myself. I’m not ashamed of admitting it if anything, admitting it helps in fixing the problem, which I do see as a problem that I have.  It started affecting me in many ways, and one of them was how people treated me. If you lack respect for yourself, then no one will respect you. Your opinion will be ignored, and you, as a whole, will b...</summary>

  <summary>I’ve survived my first year of engineering school and I’d think that’s a big deal. I don’t want to jinx it or anything, but I really have no idea what the next couple of years bring. Whatever, it’s always nice to look on the positive side.  First year was okay. The stuff we did in class wasn’t difficult although I think I’m part of that tiny percentage who believes so. I was already familiar wi...</summary>
