  <em>“A digital journal of an engineer's thoughts, ideas, and echoes in time.”</em>
</p>

Life can be tough so make the best of it while you can. This blog is my place to post opinions, look back on my experience,
and chronicle adventures. Writing makes me better understand myself, glean wisdom from errors, and hopefully steer others away
from the same pitfalls. It's about open self-examination and improvement for me, and anyone who's willing to hear.

The optimal state of mind is required as an engineer.
Clear head serves to solve difficult problems, yet it also involves knowing your own limitations and errors.
This blog is an attempt to hone that mental state by introspecting genuinely, learning every step of the way, and contributing knowledge.
Because engineering is not only about system building, but about building yourself too.

I am a second-year Computer Engineering student with an interest in Integrated Circuit design, Internet of Things, hardware programming, and cybersecurity.
I also possess a keen interest in physics, which allows me to understand the fundamentals that underlie the technology I work with.
